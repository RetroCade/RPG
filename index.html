<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Welcome to our site!</p>
<p>Currently, we are under construction. However, that's no reason to keep secrets! We expect you to want to know the concept of our project!</p>
<hr>
<p>The game will be played similarly to the way the popular games "Pokemon" and "Mother 3", both by Nintendo, are played.</p>
<p>From a third person, RPG style perspective you control Zane and and his aqcuantances, and assist them in preventing the largest catastrophe the world is yet to see.</p>
<p>Travel through the world, starting in Idaho, on a quest to gather the most mentally and physically enhanced people. Gather those who <span style="font-size:xx-large">YOU</span> think will help Zane on his journey.</p>
