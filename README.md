# RPG - A RetroCade Project
Currently, we are under construction. However, that's no reason to keep secrets! We expect you way want to know the concept of our project!

 
The game will be played similarly to the way the popular games "Pokemon" and "Mother 3", both by Nintendo, are played.

From a third person, RPG style perspective you control Zane and and his aqcuantances, and assist them in preventing the largest catastrophe the world is yet to see.

Travel through the world, starting in Idaho, on a quest to gather the most mentally and physically enhanced people. Gather those who YOU think will help Zane on his journey.
